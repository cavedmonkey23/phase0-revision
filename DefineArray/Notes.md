```JavaScript
//Define an array of numbers
const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];

//Define an array of strings
const fruits = ["apple","banana","orange"];

//Define a mixed array
const mixedArray = [1,"two",true,{name:"John",age:25}];
```
note that:
- arrays are ordered and indexed.
- the index starts at zero (0) not one(1).
- you can access elements in an array using their indexes or by referencing them with square brackets.
- You can add new items to your array using `push()` method.
- To remove last item from an array use `pop()`.
- If you want to insert something into specific position inside an array then use `splice` method which takes 3 arguments first is starting point second.
- Use `shift` to delete first element from an array.
- Use `unshift` to insert element into beginning of an array.
